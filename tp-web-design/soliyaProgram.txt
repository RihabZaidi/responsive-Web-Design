Being mature and aware student, is a good thing that will make me deal with the situation in good way .Moreover ,everyone is same as us and not everyone is aware of everyone's cultures and differences .As my parents found the way they comment and jokingly compares the food to "over-the-top street food" disrespectful then they are right. So, i would definitely talk to my colleagues and tell them that this is not good behavior in a respectful way. I would explain for them that this is what we eat and it's different on your food and that we are known by our spices .for us it's the best food but for you it's not because you got used to eat different meals.After this  i would ask them politely to apology to my parents who found this behavior as disrespectful and that to be grateful is a valuable behavior in our family no matter what is it about.
